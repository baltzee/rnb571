Use the <strong>personalized results</strong> to order new glasses online and track vision changes over time. This powerful smartphone attachment uses <strong>MIT-patented technology</strong> to measure your refractive error and provide EyeGlass Numbers - the lens power needed to correct <strong>nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism</strong>. <br><br>The VisionCheck 2 <strong>comes with the PDCheck</strong> pupillary distance measurement tool so you can <strong>quickly and accurately capture your PD and order glasses with ease. </strong>Now the VisionCheck 2 can test for reading vision, commonly know as near-vision ADD (NV ADD). This ADD number can be used for reading glasses, bifocals, or progressive lenses.</p>

          <h2>What is the VisionCheck2?</h2>
          <p>VisionCheck 2 is the world’s only <strong>do-it-yourself smartphone-powered refractive error test</strong>. Some claim to have online or app-based refraction tests, but they are merely prescription verification services based on visual acuity estimates. EyeQue users are actually performing a self-refraction test while proprietary algorithms process, personalize, and store results. Leveraging the power and ubiquity of smartphones, the mobility of VisionCheck 2 brings accurate vision correction to billions of people, many of whom lack access to traditional vision care.</p>

          <h2>Proven Accuracy</h2>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>The MIT-patented technology powering the VisionCheck 2 has been extensively tested with over 150,000 tests over the past 3 years and has been optimized to give excellent refraction values for ordering eyeglasses.</p>
          <p>Moreover, at-home vision test results can be more accurate than a single point-in-time refraction test. Since your vision fluctuates throughout the day, taking multiple tests at different times of the day gives a better average refraction than a one-time refraction test during an office visit. Especially if someone is having a bad day!</p>

          <h2>About EyeQue</h2>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3><strong>A Mission to Bring Affordable Eye Care to Everyone</strong></h3>
          <p>We’re putting accurate vision tests directly into the hands of people around the world. Our patented technology makes self-administered eye tests available to billions of people – many of whom may not have had the ability to test their eyes and correct their vision without access to low cost, convenient solutions.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h4><strong>A Global Need to Raise Our EyeQue</strong></h4>
          <p>It is estimated that more than sixty percent of the world’s population are vision impaired. Hundreds of millions of people, adults and children, are challenged daily by the discomfort and struggle of normal tasks like reading, studying, working and caring for their family. In fact, the global economic cost of lost work productivity due to people with poor vision has been estimated at 700 billion dollars per year.</p>
          <p>Refractive error, which eyeglasses correct, is the number one cause of vision impairment in the world. Yet for many families in many countries, access to an optometrist is limited or even non-existent, and the costs associated with obtaining corrective eyeglasses are not affordable. Sometimes corrective eyeglasses are not even available. Our goal is to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to self-administer an accurate refractive measurement test. With our advancements in technology, the mobility of the testing platform, and the commitment to affordable vision solutions, EyeQue will empower people all over the world to easily access and inexpensively correct their vision and improve their daily lives.</p>
          <p>Myopia (or nearsightedness) is the most common cause of blurry distance vision. If uncorrected, myopia can increase the risk of developing more serious vision problems including cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration - all of which threaten sight. Yet this condition is easily corrected, and progression can be slowed with corrective glasses.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h4>A closer look at this myopia epidemic:</h4>

          <blockquote><strong><em>Uncorrected refractive error has been steadily climbing and is now the second most common cause for blindness (~20%), with the first being cataracts (~35%).</em></strong></blockquote>
          <p>We’re taking the growing myopia epidemic head-on by rapidly developing and distributing innovative at-home vision tests and devices.</p>

          <h2>Our Road is Long and Unpaved</h2>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>We introduced the first at-home smartphone-powered refractometer in October 2016. With our continuous customer feedback in mind (primed by our Kickstarter backers!), we&#x27;re on schedule to deliver our third generation refractometer in a few months.</p>

          <h3>EyeQue&#x27;s Goals</h3>
          <p>‍</p>
          <ul start="1" role="list">
            <li>Empowering people to test their vision as often as they like in the convenience of their home.</li>
            <li>Arming the optometry, ophthalmology, and optician industries with technological advancements to improve patient care by enabling remote vision monitoring.</li>
            <li>Bringing vision testing to areas of the world that lack standard eye care and allowing people to correct their vision with eyeglasses.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>EyeQue is also actively seeking non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to use our technology to expand their reach and enhance their services, particularly in areas lacking eye care professionals.</p>
